# GoTyper

A [Hacker-Typer] clone, but instead of using client-side js it uses Go and WebSockets.
You can see it in action here: http://www.gotyper.net. You can also control the speed with - `?speed=10`.

Whats the point of this you ask? None what so ever.. I just wanted to play around with WebSockets..
but now you can pretend to write Go code just like the Go Authors and look like you know what you're doing! :D
